# Pygame Tutorial #1: Shmup (Space Shooter)

Your first Pygame project! Follow along step-by-step as we build a space shoot-em-up (aka "Shmup"). Each lesson, we'll add one feature to the code until we have a fully working game! Some of the things you'll learn how to do:

- Player Controls (keyboard)
- Handling Collisions
- Sprite Animations
- Sound and Music
- Ending the game (and restarting)
